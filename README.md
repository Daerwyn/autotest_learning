# Welcome to my Selenium training repository!

This repository contains the files that I created while learning Selenium. These files may not contain anything particularly useful or important, but they serve as a record of my learning process.

If you are also learning Selenium, you may find some of the examples and exercises in this repository to be helpful. However, please keep in mind that these files are simply for my own reference and may not be comprehensive or fully functional.

Thank you for visiting!
